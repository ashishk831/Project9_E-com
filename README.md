Objective:
We aim to segement the Customers based on RFM so that the company can target its customers efficiently.

Libraries Involved:

1. Numpy 
2. Pandas 
3. Seaborn 
4. Matplotlib 
5. KMeans 
6. StandardScaler 
7. Silhouette_score


Steps Involved:

1. Import Package
2. Reading and Understanding the Data
3. Data Cleansing
4. Data Preparation
5. Model Building
6. Final Analysis

Conclusion:

K-Means Clustering with 3 Cluster Ids
1. Customers with Cluster Id 1 are the customers with high amount of transactions as compared to other customers.
2. Customers with Cluster Id 1 are frequent buyers.
3. Customers with Cluster Id 2 are not recent buyers and hence least of importance from business point of view.
